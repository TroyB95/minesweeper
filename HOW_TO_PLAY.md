### How to play

TLDR: Right-click and flag squares which have mines under, uncover the rest of the squares without hitting a mine.

- Step 1: Select a Difficulty from the menu.

'`Tip Start on the easiest setting, and work your way up to harder settings.'`

- Step 2: Click on a square
  **Left-click** on any square. If there is a mine hidden under the square, you immediately lose the game. If there isn't a mine under the square, there will be a number – one through eight –indicating how many mines are under the eight adjacent squares touching the current square.

- Step 3: Locate other safe squares
  Determine safe squares by using the uncovered numbers. Lower numbers indicate fewer mines adjacent to that square. If the number is a "1," then there is only one mine around that square, and seven safe squares.

- Step 4: Flag possible mines
  Flag squares that you deduce are hiding mines by **right-clicking** on them.

`Tip Improperly flagging a square can cost you the game.`

- Step 5: To **win** locate all the mines
  Locate all the mines and uncover all the number squares to win the game and become the ultimate minesweeper.
